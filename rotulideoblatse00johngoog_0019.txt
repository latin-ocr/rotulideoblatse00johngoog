PREFACE.

for to some, out 01 charity or regard to their
past services, he administers full justice gra·
tuitously3 while others, either on account
of the high merite of those already in pos·
session, or through their own ill-desert,
having been guilty 01 some delinquency
against the kingdom or the King himself,
can neither by prayers nor oblations obtain
their wishes, Conceming those, the King
ordains that they are to pay no part 01 the
oblatiou until they have had right, i. e., have
obtained it by sentence, or by the cause
having been adjudged against them are de·
prived 01 all hope; but in this case it may be
sufficient to answer to the sheriff that they
have not yet had right. It is the sherill's
duty to see that it is not the debtor's fault
that the cause has not been brought to exe-
cution, as by not surrendering himself to
justice, and thus artfully defrauding the
King of his promised money; forif de-
tected his deceit shall not avail him, but
he shall be distrained in every respect as
if he had obtained his right by sentence3
and it is a proof of his wilful procrastination
when he detains the King’s writ in his

possession without using it. The King,
however, sometimes shows clemency to those
who, aster promising their money, have
lost their cause, that, disappointed in their
hopes by being deprived of their estate,
they may not have an additional motive 101

regret.’'
