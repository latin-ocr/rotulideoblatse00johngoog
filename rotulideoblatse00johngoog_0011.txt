PREFACE.

Rotas of the first, second, and third years
of that reign, and the Fma Rotas of the
sixth, seventh‚ ninth, filteenth, sixteenth, and
seventeenth years, upon the last of which
afew entries of the eighteenth year are
also recorded.

During the reign of John the entries on
the Oblata or Fine Rolls are, for the most
part, mere notices of the oblations or fines
offered¹3 but in subsequent reigns they are
more comprehensive, containing not only
memoranda similar to those occurring in this
Volume, but also writs and ulterior proceedings
connected with the object for which the Fine
had been made 3 for instance,

Mnnoaanoa of homage and fealty done,
and reliefs paid by tenants in capite, and

by their tenants‚ when the tenant in capite
happened to be a minor.

the reign of Henry ΙΙΙ. has lotely been published‚
under the direction of the Commissioners for Public
Records, in a norlr intituled, “ Excerpta ὲ Rotulis Finium
in Turri Londinensi asservatis.” The Editor of that
Volume has made his selection nith a view to remedy,
in some measure, the loss of the inquisitione post mortem
oi the reign of Henry Ill.. and his work comprises almost

’ every thing valuable on those rolls.

¹ Such as “Walter eon of Godsrey offers to the lord
the King filty marlia, to hare the custody of the land
and heir of Robert de Watleg.'’·- “ Richard Talameg and
Robert de Anvers give to the lord the King ten marks,
to have a writ of mort d'encertor concerning two
knight'r fees.” Ι
