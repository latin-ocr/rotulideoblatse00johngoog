PREFACE. xxxvii

thenceforward took a handle (from the arn· ‘'m—”2²⁴⁸
biguity of this expression heredes) to claim ssfflvdlm
both “ sive sit masculos sive femina,” as

Bracton more than once expresses it'’

The following instances, taken frorn this
work and the other records of the reign of King
John lately printed, show, however,that Black-
stone entertained an erroneous opinion on this
point, for they prove that fines had been nrade
to the King by various persons to obtain the
marriage of his male tenants in capite, and that
the encroachment of guardiam upon the rights
of their mole words had commenced antece·
dently even to the Great Charter of King
John 3 itis, however, true that the instances of
the marriage of mole words being granted

and sold are but few in proportion to those
of female wards.

Master Michael Belet offers to the lord the King

the sons and heire of their homagers, aod of their sees. ·
that they exercise an absolute control, with respect to
presenting to churches in their custody, in manyiny
ferrales {f duty foll into wardehip, and in regulating other
manens—(Lib. 9. c. 9.) Again, the same writer ob·
serves, “ But if heire cre semeles, they shell remain in
the custody of their lords; if minore, they shell con·
tinne in custody until they are of full age, at which
period the lord is bound to find thern a marriage3 but
if they are of full ege, then also they shall remain in
the custody of their lord until, with his advice end
disposel, they ere married, because, without enrety, no
female heir to land con, by the law and custom of the
reelm, be rnarricd.''-(Lib. 9. c. 12.)
