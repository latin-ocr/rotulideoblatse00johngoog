PREFACE.

onas-[ross with the matrimonial election of his female
ιιι. abachum ward was one of the great hardships of the

feudal tenure.

Sebilia de Tingere offers to the lord the King
200 marks to have the land of Maretoc and Wen-

holding, sothe goodwill οι the lord, and his consent to
that act, ought first to be obtained, lest he should be

compelled to receive homage for his fies from an enemy,
or from an improper or unqualified person, and thus the
fiel, which was given for the defence and service ol tbe
lord, should be used to annoy him ; and the same reason
was applicable to widows if they married agaim sor
Glanville‚ lib. 7. ο. 12, expressly states, that an heiress
who had once been lawfully married, if she became a
widow‚ was not to return into the custody of her lord;
though if she made a second marriage she was under
the same obligation as before ιο ask his consent. The
law, as laid down by Glanville, is fully corroborated
by the entries on the Fine Rolls respecting the lord's
consent being requirite for the marriage of his widow
tenants; for instance, we find that “ Alice, conntess of
Warwiclr, gives AElnoo and ten palfreys‚ ιιιι ιιι moy
