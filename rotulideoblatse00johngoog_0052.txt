Gervase, and Elyas Fita Runild for the death of the Μ
same John Monk3 and they are agreed thereon.

Considerable sums of money were paid ⁵5?,‚¹{³,”“s⁰'²¹¹‘¹‘¹”⁸''
to obtain the favor of the King, and to ’
induce him to mitigate or remit his anger
and displeasure. The most enormous pay·
ment perhaps ever made upon such occa-
sions was given by the citizens of London to
King Henry III. to obtain that monarch’s
goodwill. No lessasum than twenty thousand
marks ¹, more than equivalent, in those days,
to two hundred thousand pounds in these, was
paid by them. The ‘occasion of this high fine

was the active part which the mutinous popu-
lace of London took in the civil wars and

commotione that distracted the kingdom
during the disaffection of the earls of Leices·
ter and Gloucester, between the years ram
and 1270.

Henry Tirel offers to the lord the King 30 marks
to have the King’s, goodwiil.
