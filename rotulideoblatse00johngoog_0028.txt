PREFACE. xix

The enatae on these rolls consist prin· ⁰¹12&ss
cipally of voluntary Fines3 and a selection,
under each of the above divisione, will at
once explain their nature, and show in what
way these rccords elucidate the ancient lawe,
usages, and manners of the times to which
they refer.

1. Fines roa Garun-s lun Conrrauarrons
or Lrnenrres run Fnaucursas.

Many fines. were paid for granta and asmo}
confirmations of liberties, franchises, and wodsto-

immunities; and though the entries on the
rolls are limited to mere memoranda, (stating

that such and such parties paid sums of money
to enjoy certain liberties) yet they supply
information no where else to be obtained, for

upon investigation it has been found, that
several fines were paid for grants not aster·

warde enrolled. The following are examples:

'Ihe citizens of Lincoln offer to the lord the
King 300 marks to have the city of Lincoln etiarm,
aa they had in the time of King Richard, and for
having the King's confirmation of that farm, &c

The abhot of Dore offers to the lord the King

&333 6⁸. Sd. that he may freely and quietly essert,
